## Process

### Phase 0: Discovery & Planning (MANDATORY)
- **Trigger**: New project, new feature, or missing documentation.
- BEFORE writing any code:
    1. Review `docs/00_tech_stack.md` and `README.md`.
    2. If empty or generic, ask user for specs.
    3. Draft Overview, Tech Stack, Key Features into `docs/00_tech_stack.md`.
    4. Create a Todo list. WAIT for user approval.

### Phase 1: Implementation
- Analyze (align with tech stack) -> Security Scan -> Plan -> Execute.
- Keep `docs/00_tech_stack.md` updated as source of truth.
- No new packages without explicit justification and user approval.
